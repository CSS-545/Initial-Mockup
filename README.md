## Relevance to Target Demographic

The design of Greenie's MVP aligns well with the needs of individual users seeking to verify themselves professionally. By focusing on essential verification processes like location and work history verification, Greenie addresses key pain points faced by job seekers and professionals seeking to establish their credibility in the hiring process. The user-friendly interface and clear indicators for verification status cater to users looking for a streamlined and reliable verification experience.

## Happy Path

The "happy path" refers to the ideal scenario where a user successfully navigates through the Greenie app without encountering any errors or obstacles. In this context, it involves a user signing into the app, creating an account, and seamlessly initiating the verification process for their permanent residency and work history.  
`User comes to the app`->`User logs in`->`User creates an account`->`User initiates verification process`->`User submits required documents/information`->`User receives verification confirmation`
